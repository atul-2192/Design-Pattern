# 🏛️ Java Design Patterns – A Developer’s Journey

> *"Every great software is built upon invisible blueprints — these are called **Design Patterns**."*

Welcome to this repository, where we explore the **art and science** of writing clean, reusable, and scalable code through design patterns.
Think of this as your **treasure map** into the world of software architecture — where each pattern is a powerful tool forged by decades of developer wisdom.

## 📖 The Story Behind Design Patterns

Long ago, software engineers faced the same battles over and over:

* **How to create objects without making the code rigid?**
* **How to structure systems so they are easy to change?**
* **How to let objects talk without making them too dependent?**

Out of these battles came a **book of wisdom** — the *Gang of Four*’s *Design Patterns* — a collection of **timeless solutions** to common problems in software design.

This repository is my **training ground** — where I practice, document, and share **Java implementations** for each of these patterns.
Whether you’re a **beginner warrior** or a **seasoned architect**, you’ll find something valuable here.

## 🗂️ The Three Kingdoms of Design Patterns

Design patterns are grouped into **three great kingdoms**, each with its own philosophy:

### 1️⃣ Creational Patterns – *The Architects* 🏗️

These patterns are the master builders of objects. They decide **how and when** objects come to life.

* **Singleton** – The one and only.
* **Factory Method** – A workshop that makes the right object for you.
* **Abstract Factory** – A factory that makes other factories.
* **Builder** – Step-by-step object creation.
* **Prototype** – Cloning existing blueprints.

---

### 2️⃣ Structural Patterns – *The Engineers* 🏛️

They care about how things are connected — making structures flexible without unnecessary complexity.

* **Adapter** – Translating one interface to another.
* **Bridge** – Separating abstraction from implementation.
* **Composite** – Tree-like structures of objects.
* **Decorator** – Wrapping objects with extra powers.
* **Facade** – A friendly front door to a complex system.
* **Flyweight** – Memory-efficient object sharing.
* **Proxy** – A placeholder that controls access.

---

### 3️⃣ Behavioral Patterns – *The Strategists* 🎯

These patterns focus on **how objects talk and behave**.

* **Strategy** – Swapping algorithms like changing gears.
* **Observer** – Notifying many when one changes.
* **Command** – Turning requests into objects.
* **Chain of Responsibility** – Passing requests along a chain.
* **Interpreter** – Understanding a custom language.
* **Iterator** – Stepping through elements without knowing the structure.
* **Mediator** – Centralizing complex communications.
* **Memento** – Saving and restoring states.
* **State** – Changing behavior when internal state changes.
* **Template Method** – Defining the steps, letting subclasses fill in the details.
* **Visitor** – Adding operations without changing objects.

## 🚀 Why This Repo Exists

I created this repository to:

* Practice writing **clean, reusable Java code**.
* Have a **ready reference** for interviews and real projects.
* Help others learn **not just the “what” but also the “why”** behind each pattern.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repository

1. Browse by pattern type (**creational**, **structural**, **behavioral**).
2. Open the corresponding folder.
3. Read the code and explanations.
4. Run the examples to see the pattern in action.

## 📌 Final Words

Design patterns are not just “bookish concepts” — they are **battle-tested wisdom** that make your code **scalable, maintainable, and beautiful**.
Master them, and you’ll not only write better code but also **think like a software architect**.

💡 *“First learn the rules, then learn when to break them.”*

I can also add **ASCII diagrams** for each pattern in the README so it’s more visually engaging and beginner-friendly.
Do you want me to add those visual diagrams next?
