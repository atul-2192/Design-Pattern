💳 Payment Gateway Extender
🌟 What is this Project?

This project is about making online payments more flexible and smarter.
Think of it like this:

You already have a basic payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay).

Now you want to add extra features like:

✅ Fraud check

✅ Currency conversion (USD → INR)

✅ Discounts

✅ Reward points

But instead of rewriting everything, we use a plug-and-play approach.
So, you can turn features ON/OFF or rearrange them based on business needs.

🎯 Why this Matters?

For Business: Faster to add new features without touching old code.

For Developers: Clean design, easy testing, easy maintenance.

For Customers: Safe, smart, and transparent payments.

📦 How it Works (Simple Flow)

A customer makes a payment → system takes request.

Features are applied in order (Fraud Check → Discount → Rewards).

Final payment is processed with the gateway.

Customer gets the response (success, amount charged, etc.).

🖥️ How to Use it

Run the project → it starts a web service.

Open your browser at 👉 http://localhost:8080/swagger

You’ll see a friendly dashboard to try payments.

Example request:

{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "INR",
  "gateway": "stripe",
  "features": ["fraudCheck", "discount", "rewardPoints"]
}


Response:

{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "finalAmount": 900,
  "message": "Processed with fraudCheck → discount → rewardPoints"
}
